Description: # etfs: security analysis toolkit
        
        
        
        ## Purpose
        
        *etfs* is a Python package that makes it easy to gather data on securities, compute statistics, and find trends. It offers a wide range of tools to analyze securities, such as stocks and bonds, or compositions of securities, such as portfolios or ETFs.
        
        
        
        ## Main Features
        
        
        Input features:
          - Load in Vanguard portfolios (from a CSV file downloaded from a Vanguard account) or other custom portfolios from a CSV file with a list of transactions (e.g. from RobinHood).
          - Retrieves historical price and volume data from Yahoo! Finance.
        
        Basic methods on historical price data:
          - run rate (e.g., 50-day / 200-day moving average)
          - exponentially weighted moving average
          - resampling (e.g., day, week, month)
          - standard deviation
          - variance
          - `R^2`
          - beta
          - alpha
        
        Output:
          - detailed portfolio description (positions, current value, returns, investments, devestments)
          - growth timeseries plots 
          - candlestick plots
          - Heikin-Ashi plots
